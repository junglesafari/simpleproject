        This tale from India is about a good-hearted Brahman -
or holy man - who helps a tiger out of a trap.
The tiger then turns on him and threatens to eat him.
The Brahman struggles to find any one - or any thing
that will agree that the tiger is wrong. Everyone he asks
seems to think that ingratitude is the way of the world
and he should accept his fate. Then along comes a jackal
who appears to be very dim... Perhaps he can save the
Brahman from the tiger.
The story was collected in the 19th century by Joseph
Jacobs who was born in Australia and came to England.
One of the interesting things about it is the way that the
road a tree speak, on the same level as the animals and
the holy man.
-----lets starts the story-----

The Brahman, the Tiger And the Jackal

Once upon a time, a tiger was caught in a trap.
He tried in vain to get out through the bars, and
rolled and bit with rage and grief when he failed.
By chance a poor Brahman came by.
“Let me out of this cage, oh holy one!” cried the tiger.

“Nay, my friend,” replied the Brahman mildly, “you
would probably eat me if I did.”

“Not at all!” swore the tiger with many oaths;
“on the contrary, I should be for ever grateful, and
serve you as a slave!”

Now when the tiger sobbed and sighed and wept
and swore, the good Brahman’s heart softened, and
at last he consented to open the door of the cage.
Out popped the tiger, and, seizing the poor man,
cried, “What a fool you are! What is to prevent my
eating you now, for after being cooped up so long
I am just terribly hungry!”

In vain the Brahman pleaded for his life; at last the
Tiger agreed that if the Brahman could ask three
things to judge whether or not the Tiger was treating
him unfairly. If one of them would say that he should
keep his life, then the Tiger would not eat him, but
would let him go.

So the Brahman first asked a pipal tree what it thought
of the matter, but the pipal tree replied coldly,
“What have you to complain about? Don’t I give shade
and shelter to every one who passes by, and don’t
they return my kindness by tearing down my branches
to feed their cattle? Don’t whimper–be a man!”

Then the Brahman, sad at heart, went further afield till
he saw a buffalo turning a well-wheel; but he got no
better result, for it answered, “You are a fool to expect
gratitude! Look at me! When I gave milk , the people
fed me on cotton-seed and oil-cake, but now I am dry
they tie me here, and give me their rubbish for food!”

The Brahman, still more sad, asked the road to give
him its opinion.

“My dear sir,” said the road, “how foolish you are to
expect anything else! Here am I, useful to everybody,
yet all, rich and poor, great and small, trample on
me as they go past.”

At this the Brahman turned back sorrowfully, and
on the way he met a jackal, who called out, “Why,
what’s the matter, Mr. Brahman? You look as
miserable as a fish out of water!”

The Brahman told him all that had happened.
“How very confusing!” said the jackal, when the
recital was ended; “would you mind telling me
over again, for everything has got so mixed up?”

The Brahman told it all over again, but the jackal
shook his head in a distracted sort of way, and
still could not understand.

“It’s very odd,” said he, sadly, “but it all seems
to go in at one ear and out at the other! I will
go to the place where it all happened, and then
perhaps I shall be able to give a judgment.”

So they returned to the cage, by which the tiger
was waiting for the Brahman, and sharpening
his teeth and claws.

“You’ve been away a long time!” growled the
savage beast, “but now let us begin our dinner.”

“Our dinner!” thought the wretched Brahman,
as his knees knocked together with fright;
“what a remarkably delicate way of putting it!”

“Give me five minutes, my lord!” he pleaded,
“in order that I may explain matters to the
jackal here, who is somewhat slow in his wits.”

The tiger consented, and the Brahman began
the whole story over again, not missing a single
 detail, and spinning as long a yarn as possible.

“Oh, my poor brain! oh, my poor brain!” cried the
jackal, wringing its paws. “Let me see! how did
it all begin? You were in the cage, and the tiger
came walking by–”

“Pooh!” interrupted the tiger, “what a fool you
are! I was in the cage.”

“Of course!” cried the jackal, pretending to
tremble with fright; “yes! I was in the cage–no
I wasn’t–dear! dear! where are my wits? Let me
see–the tiger was in the Brahman, and the cage
came walking by–no, that’s not it, either! Well,
don’t mind me, but begin your dinner, for I
shall never understand!”

“Yes, you shall!” returned the tiger, in a rage
at the jackal’s stupidity; “I’ll make you
understand! Look here–I am the tiger–”

“Yes, my lord!”

“And that is the Brahman–”

“Yes, my lord!”

“And that is the cage–”

“Yes, my lord!”

“And I was in the cage–do you understand?”

“Yes–no–Please, my lord–”

“Well?”

“Please, my lord!–how did you get in?”

“How!–why in the usual way, of course!”

“Oh, dear me!–my head is beginning to whirl
again! Please don’t be angry, my lord, but
what is the usual way?”

At this the tiger lost patience, and, jumping
into the cage, cried, "This way! Now do you
understand how it was?”

“Perfectly!” grinned the jackal, as he
dexterously shut the door, “and if you will
permit me to say so, I think matters will
remain as they were!”

And that’s the story of how the Jackal
helped the Brahman escape from the Tiger.
